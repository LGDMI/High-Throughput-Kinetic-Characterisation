# High-Throughput-Kinetic-Characterisation

All codes and scripts used in the data processing and model simulations described in Candry et al. (2017).

Overview of files:
- GrowthCurveProcessing.R: Script used to process growth curves and obtain growth rate data for each well.
- ExampleData.xlsx: Example growth curve data to demonstrate GrowthcurveProcessing.R. Data reported in Candry et al. (submitted).
- Kinetic and Dynamic Model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for further analysis of growth rate data for determination of kinetic parameters in Clostridium kluyveri and subsequent use of these parameters for simulation of growth of and hexanoic acid production by C. kluyveri.
- ProcessedData_Example.csv: Data used for determination of kinetic parameters (see Candry et al. (submitted)) in 'Kinetic and Dynamic Model.ipynb'.
